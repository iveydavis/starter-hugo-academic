Hi there! I'm a fourth year graduate student in the astronomy department at Caltech where I'm advised by [Gregg Hallinan](https://pma.caltech.edu/people/gregg-w-hallinan). I'm interested in all things stellar at metric wavelengths, especially such things related to star-planet interactions. My thesis is focused on multi-wavelength monitoring of space weather from young, sun-like stars, for which I've been designing the optical observatory and commissioning the radio instrument. As of Fall 2023, science operations on both instruments has begun.

I'm always excited to share science with folks, especially middle and high schoolers. While at Caltech, I've been involved in the [star-gazing lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8bZ7fBSmrA), observing outreach, and [event organizing](https://hr.caltech.edu/news/eclipse-viewing-party-draws-hundreds-to-caltech-2023). Outside of Caltech, I've been able to engage the public through the [Owens Valley Radio Observatory](https://bishopvisitor.com/event/astronomy-lecture-series-cosmic-acoustics/) [lecture series](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1l73D4THHIxnWU40V0MQCLqNjcmZDG8wEX5XNsSXFR8Y/edit?usp=sharing), the [Pasadena Astro on Tap](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IOI4mQ72Mk0zWsxetXK58mS7hCqIJ8bIDezSrK4Bk_o/edit?usp=sharing), and [Astrobites](https://astrobites.org/author/idavis/).
