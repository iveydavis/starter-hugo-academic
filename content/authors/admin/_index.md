Hi there! I'm a third year graduate student in the astronomy department at Caltech where I'm advised by [Gregg Hallinan](https://pma.caltech.edu/people/gregg-w-hallinan). I'm interested in all things stellar at metric wavelengths, especially such things related to star-planet interactions. My thesis is focused on multi-wavelength monitoring of space weather from young, sun-like stars, for which I've been designing the optical observatory (first light by end of 2022!) and commissioning the radio instrument.

I'm always excited to share science with folks, especially middle and high schoolers. While at Caltech, I've been involved in the [star-gazing lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8bZ7fBSmrA) and observing outreach as well as the [Owens Valley Radio Observatory](https://bishopvisitor.com/event/astronomy-lecture-series-cosmic-acoustics/) [lecture series](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1l73D4THHIxnWU40V0MQCLqNjcmZDG8wEX5XNsSXFR8Y/edit?usp=sharing).
