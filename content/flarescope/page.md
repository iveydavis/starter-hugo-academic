# Flarescope
## A Space-weather Monitoring Optical Instrument
</center>

Flarescope is a fully automated observatory being installed on Palomar mountain that represents the culmination of my first three years of research at Caltech. A combination of a small aperture (0.5m), engineered diffusers, a frame-transfer EMCCD, and a high-precision tracking mount that allows it to reach sub-mmag precision on bright targets (m > 2) on the order of 5-10 minutes. Flarescope will be monitoring stellar activity from nearby, sun-like stars simultaneously with the Long Wavelength Array at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO-LWA) in order to characterize space-weather from young, solar analogs. The coordination of Flarescope and OVRO-LWA represents the beginning of a pan-chromatic study of extrasolar space weather in an attempt to constrain habitability and exo-biogenesis. 

As of November 2023, Flarescope is operational! The performance review paper will be submitted and made available soon, but in the meantime, you can read the PDR [here](Flarescope_PDR.pdf) if you want to learn more! Note that the current implementation of Flarescope does not have a guide scope and uses a 0.5m rather than 0.4m aperture.
